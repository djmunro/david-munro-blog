I was inspired today by a poem I heard.

<strong>Good Timber</strong>

```js
The tree that never had to fight
     For sun and sky and air and light,
But stood out in the open plain
     And always got its share of rain,
Never became a forest king
     But lived and died a scrubby thing.

The man who never had to toil
     To gain and farm his patch of soil,
Who never had to win his share
     Of sun and sky and light and air,
Never became a manly man
     But lived and died as he began.

Good timber does not grow with ease,
     The stronger wind, the stronger trees,
The further sky, the greater length,
     The more the storm, the more the strength.
By sun and cold, by rain and snow,
     In trees and men good timbers grow.

Where thickest lies the forest growth
     We find the patriarchs of both.
And they hold counsel with the stars
     Whose broken branches show the scars
Of many winds and much of strife.
     This is the common law of life.
```

The poem is all about toughness, grit, and seeing a hard life as a life that stands above others.

This got me thinking about mastery and my current stage of mastery with the things that I have intentionally strived towards.
There are two things that I'm pursing mastery in.

The first being my career. I'm a software engineer, and over the last 3 years or so I've been obsessed at learning and getting better at
developing software. The second is disc golf. My time is quite limited and not always in my control due to parenting and husband-ing things.
Because of this I'm constantly trying to optimize the way I practice to fit within my schedule. I play leagues every Monday and have committed
myself to being the most practiced putter who plays in the league.

Pursing mastery in these two disciplines I've recognized there are common traits that apply to becoming better
in these two and probably any disciple and I'd like to share what I've learned.

The traits are:
- Consistency
- Intentional Training
- Curiosity
- Studying
- Mental Fortitude

## 1. Consistency
In order to master anything, weather it's disc golf, becoming a better engineer or anything for that matter it
requires hard work. While some people have a latent (natural) ability towards a discipline over others that can
take them far, however, to fully master anything requires consistent practice. You must put in the time to become better.
For example, if I want to become better at putting, I need to practice everyday to build both the muscles and muscle memory.

## 2. Intentional Training

## 3. Curiosity

## 4. Studying
In order to master anything it requires study. Study of yourself as well as others. For instance I've been studying
how professional disc golfers putt. I have trouble making long putts outside the putting circle (~33 feet). Specifically I have
trouble generating power to get the disc to the basket. So I began watching videos to understand what mechanics are the professionals
doing that I wasn't. After finding someone I wanted to emulate I began practicing everyday to transform my form.

The same principal of studying applies to my mastery of software engineering. I read others code as well as read software
articles in order to improve the way I organize and communicate code.

Mastery trait #4 (Studying) is a main block in the pyramid and leads us towards becoming the best we can be.

## 5. Mental Fortitude
