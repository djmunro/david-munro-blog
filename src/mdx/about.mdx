## Bio
Hi there! my name is David Munro. I'm 35 years old. A father of 4 and married to my beautiful bride Laura.

I am a fullstack developer by trade.

I'm on a journey to become a master in multiple disciplines. I'm in the process of becoming the best engineer that I can be.
Secondly I'm striving to become the best disc golfer that I can be. Life is pretty busy with a full-time job and a family of 6, however,
I'm determined to not be outworked in the things that I'm able to do. I have time to practice putting and am dedicated to put in the
daily practice for mastery.

I find writing a useful way to express my thoughts and to understand how to plan and live my life in a more intentional way.
Thus the creation of this blog. It will be the medium I plan to use to document my thoughts and hope that any visitors that
may stumble upon my rantings may enjoy or benefit from the time I've spent on it.

Please feel free to reach out to me personally if you want to talk about anything <a href="mailto:munrodj86@gmail.com">munrodj86@gmail.com</a>
